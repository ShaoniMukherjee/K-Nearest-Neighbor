# K-Nearest-Neighbor

How does the KNN algorithm work?
In KNN, K is the number of nearest neighbors. The number of neighbors is the core deciding factor. 
K is generally an odd number if the number of classes is 2. When K=1, then the algorithm is known as the nearest neighbor algorithm.
This is the simplest case. Suppose P1 is the point, for which label needs to predict.
First, you find the one closest point to P1 and then the label of the nearest point assigned to P1.
